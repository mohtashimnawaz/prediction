### Thread: How It Works

```
🧵 How Solana Prediction Market Works

A thread on the fairest prediction market ever built 👇

1/7
```

```
1/ CREATE A MARKET 🏗️

Anyone can create a yes/no prediction market:
- Ask a question
- Set an end time
- Deploy on-chain

Cost: ~$0.0001
Time: <1 second

No permission needed. No intermediaries. Just you and Solana.

2/7
```

```
2/ PLACE YOUR BETS 💰

Users bet SOL tokens on YES or NO.

All funds go into a PDA-secured vault.
No one—not even us—can touch them until resolution.

That's the power of smart contracts. 

3/7
```

```
3/ THE POOL GROWS 📈

As more people bet, the pool grows.
The odds shift based on the YES/NO ratio.

Everything is transparent.
Everything is on-chain.
Everyone can verify.

4/7
```

```
4/ MARKET RESOLVES ⚖️

After the event concludes, the oracle resolves the market.

This can be:
- The market creator (simple)
- A decentralized oracle (advanced)
- A governance vote (community-driven)

5/7
```

```
5/ WINNERS CLAIM 🏆

If you bet on the winning side, you claim your share.

Your payout = (Your bet / Total winning bets) × Total pool

Example:
- You bet 1 SOL on YES
- Total YES: 10 SOL
- Total pool: 15 SOL
- You get: 1.5 SOL (50% profit!)

6/7
```

```
6/ RINSE & REPEAT ♻️

Create more markets.
Bet on more outcomes.
Build your reputation.

All on-chain. All verifiable. All fair.

That's the vision.

### Title
```
🔮 I built a zero-fee prediction market on Solana (Indie.fun Hackathon)
```

### Body
```
Hey Solana community! 👋

I just finished building a fully decentralized prediction market platform for the Indie.fun Hackathon, and I wanted to share it with you all.

**What is it?**

A platform where anyone can create yes/no prediction markets, bet on outcomes with SOL, and claim winnings—all on-chain with zero platform fees.

**Why Solana?**

- ⚡ **Speed**: Bets confirm in ~400ms
- 💰 **Cost**: ~$0.00001 per transaction
- 📈 **Scalability**: Can handle thousands of concurrent markets
- 🔧 **Developer Experience**: Anchor makes it a joy to build

**Technical Highlights:**

- Built with Anchor framework
- PDA-based vault for secure fund custody
- 100% test coverage on all instructions
- Gas-optimized for high throughput
- MIT licensed and fully open source

**How It Works:**

1. Create a market with a question and end time
2. Users bet SOL on YES or NO outcomes
3. Oracle resolves the market after the event
4. Winners claim proportional payouts from the total pool

**Key Innovation: Zero House Edge**

Unlike traditional betting (10-15% house edge) or other prediction market DEXs (2-5% fees), we take ZERO fees. 100% of the pool goes to winners.

**GitHub**: [link]  
**Demo Video**: [coming soon]

This was a solo hackathon project built over 2 weeks. I'm planning to add a web frontend next, then oracle integration, and eventually a mobile app.

Would love your feedback! What features would you want to see? What markets would you create?

Also, if any judges from Indie.fun are reading this... hi! 👋

🚀 Excited to share my latest project: Solana Prediction Market!

I just completed this fully decentralized prediction market platform for the Indie.fun Hackathon, and I couldn't be more proud of what we built.

**The Challenge:** Traditional prediction markets are slow, expensive, and take significant platform fees (often 10-15%).

**The Solution:** A Solana-native platform with:
• Sub-second transaction confirmations
• ~$0.00001 transaction costs
• Zero platform fees—100% of pools go to winners
• Fully decentralized and open source

**Technical Stack:**
• Rust + Anchor framework
• PDA-based security architecture
• Comprehensive test coverage
• Production-ready code

This project showcases how Solana's unique architecture enables applications that simply aren't possible on other blockchains. The combination of speed, cost, and developer tooling makes it the ideal platform for high-frequency applications like prediction markets.

Special thanks to @Indie.fun, @Solana Foundation, and the amazing Solana developer community for the support!
